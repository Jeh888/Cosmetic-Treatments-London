      {
        question: 'How long does professional teeth whitening last?',
        answer: 'Professional teeth whitening results typically last between 6 months to 2 years, depending on your diet, oral hygiene, and lifestyle habits. Avoiding staining foods and drinks can help maintain results longer.'

        question: 'Is teeth whitening safe?',
        answer: 'Yes, when performed by qualified dental professionals using approved products, teeth whitening is very safe. Some temporary sensitivity is normal but usually subsides within a few days.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What\'s the difference between in-clinic and at-home whitening?',
        answer: 'In-clinic treatments use stronger whitening agents and produce faster, more dramatic results in a single session. At-home kits use custom-fitted trays with gentler formulas worn over several weeks.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How white can my teeth get?',
        answer: 'Results vary depending on your natural tooth colour and the type of staining. Most patients achieve 2-8 shades lighter. Your dentist will assess your teeth and give you realistic expectations.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I whiten my teeth if I have crowns or veneers?',
        answer: 'Whitening treatments only work on natural teeth. Crowns, veneers, and fillings won\'t change colour. Your dentist may recommend replacing these after whitening to match your new shade.'

      {
        question: 'How long does Invisalign treatment take?',

      {
        question: 'How often do I need to wear my aligners?',
        answer: 'For best results, aligners should be worn for 20-22 hours per day. They should only be removed for eating, drinking anything other than water, and brushing your teeth.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can anyone get Invisalign?',
        answer: 'Invisalign can treat most cases of misalignment, overcrowding, and bite issues. However, very complex cases may require traditional braces. A consultation will determine if you\'re a suitable candidate.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do I need to wear a retainer after Invisalign?',
        answer: 'Yes, retainers are essential to maintain your results. Your provider will recommend either a permanent bonded retainer or removable retainers to wear at night.'

    ],
    'botox': [
      {
        question: 'How long do Botox results last?',
        answer: 'Botox results typically last 3-6 months. With regular treatments, some patients find results last longer as the muscles become trained to relax.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Will I look frozen or unnatural?',

      {
        question: 'At what age should I start Botox?',
        answer: 'There\'s no set age to start Botox. Some people begin in their late 20s as a preventative measure, while others start later to treat existing wrinkles. It depends on your individual concerns.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How soon will I see results?',
        answer: 'You\'ll start to see results within 3-5 days, with full effects visible at around 14 days. Your practitioner may schedule a follow-up to assess results.'

      {
        question: 'How long do dermal fillers last?',

      {
        question: 'How long do veneers last?',

      },
      {
        question: 'Are veneers permanent?',

      },
      {
        question: 'Do veneers look natural?',
        answer: 'High-quality porcelain veneers are designed to mimic natural teeth in colour, translucency, and texture. Skilled cosmetic dentists ensure veneers complement your facial features.'

      {
        question: 'Can I eat normally with veneers?',
        answer: 'Yes, you can eat most foods normally. However, avoid biting directly into very hard foods like ice or using your teeth to open packages, as this can damage veneers.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What\'s the difference between porcelain and composite veneers?',
        answer: 'Porcelain veneers are more durable, stain-resistant, and natural-looking but cost more. Composite veneers are more affordable and require less tooth preparation but may need replacing sooner.'

      {
        question: 'How long does dental bonding last?',
        answer: 'Dental bonding typically lasts 3-10 years depending on the location, bite forces, and how well you care for your teeth. Touch-ups or replacements may be needed over time.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is dental bonding noticeable?',
        answer: 'When performed by a skilled dentist, bonding blends seamlessly with your natural teeth. The composite resin is shade-matched to your surrounding teeth for natural results.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Does dental bonding damage teeth?',
        answer: 'No, bonding is one of the most conservative cosmetic treatments. It typically requires minimal or no removal of tooth enamel, preserving your natural tooth structure.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can bonding stain?',
        answer: 'Composite resin can stain over time, especially from coffee, tea, wine, and smoking. However, stains are usually surface-level and can be polished away at dental visits.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is bonding better than veneers?',
        answer: 'Bonding is better for minor imperfections and is more affordable and conservative. Veneers are better for more significant changes and last longer. Your dentist will recommend the best option.'

    'lip-fillers': [
      {
        question: 'How long do lip fillers last?',
        answer: 'Lip fillers typically last 6-12 months. The lips have high blood flow, so fillers tend to metabolise faster here than in other areas. Regular top-ups maintain results.'
      },

        answer: 'When administered by a skilled practitioner, lip fillers should look natural and proportionate to your face. Communication about your goals is key to achieving the look you want.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How painful are lip injections?',
        answer: 'Most patients describe the sensation as mild discomfort rather than pain. Topical numbing cream is applied beforehand, and most fillers contain lidocaine for additional comfort.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What\'s the recovery time for lip fillers?',
        answer: 'Most people return to normal activities immediately. Swelling and bruising are common for 2-7 days. Final results are visible once swelling subsides, usually within 2 weeks.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can lip fillers be removed?',
        answer: 'Yes, hyaluronic acid lip fillers can be dissolved with hyaluronidase if you\'re unhappy with results. The lips will return to their pre-treatment appearance.'

        question: 'Are dental crowns painful?',

      },
      {
        question: 'What\'s the difference between a crown and a veneer?',
        answer: 'Crowns cover the entire tooth and are used for damaged or weakened teeth. Veneers only cover the front surface and are primarily cosmetic. Your dentist will recommend the appropriate option.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can a crowned tooth get a cavity?',
        answer: 'The crown itself can\'t decay, but the tooth underneath can. Good oral hygiene and regular check-ups are essential to prevent decay at the crown margin.'

      {
        question: 'How many visits does a crown require?',
        answer: 'Traditional crowns require 2 visits: one for preparation and impressions, and another to fit the crown. Same-day crowns using CEREC technology can be completed in one visit.'

      {
        question: 'Why do cosmetic treatment prices vary so much?',

      {
        question: 'Is cosmetic dentistry available on the NHS?',
        answer: 'Generally, cosmetic treatments are not available on the NHS, which only covers clinically necessary dental work. Private treatment is required for purely aesthetic procedures.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Are payment plans available?',

      {
        question: 'What should be included in a treatment quote?',
        answer: 'A comprehensive quote should include all costs: consultation, treatment, any necessary follow-ups, and materials. Ask about what\'s included to avoid unexpected charges.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is it worth paying more for experienced providers?',
        answer: 'Experience often matters significantly in cosmetic treatments. Skilled practitioners typically achieve better, more natural results and can handle complications if they arise.'

    'dental-marketing': [

      },
      {
        question: 'How long before marketing shows results?',
